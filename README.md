# Guest Checkout Management

## Introduction
Welcome to the Guest Checkout Management project! This document provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, technology stack, and how to get started.

## What the Application is About
Guest Checkout Management is designed to simplify the process of managing guest checkouts in various settings such as hotels, events, and more. The application offers a user-friendly interface for handling guest information, managing checkout processes, and generating comprehensive reports.

## Technology Stack
The project is built using the following technologies:
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: A fully-managed cloud database service for modern applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

## Why Node.js?
Node.js is chosen for this project because of its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it ideal for building scalable and efficient web applications. Its extensive ecosystem of libraries and modules also accelerates development.

## Why MongoDB Atlas?
MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service that provides high availability, scalability, and security. It allows us to focus on developing the application without worrying about database management tasks.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for managing guest checkouts
- Secure handling of guest information
- Comprehensive reporting tools

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key components:

### Backend
- **server.js**: The entry point of the application. It sets up the Express server and connects to MongoDB Atlas.
- **routes/**: Contains the route definitions for handling API requests.
- **controllers/**: Contains the logic for handling requests and interacting with the database.
- **models/**: Defines the data models used in the application.

### Frontend
- **src/**: Contains the React application code.
  - **components/**: Contains the React components used in the application.
  - **pages/**: Contains the different pages of the application.
  - **App.js**: The main component that sets up the routing for the application.
  - **index.js**: The entry point of the React application.

## API Endpoints
The backend API provides several endpoints for managing guest checkouts. Here are some of the key endpoints:

- `GET /api/guests`: Retrieve a list of all guests.
- `POST /api/guests`: Add a new guest.
- `GET /api/guests/:id`: Retrieve details of a specific guest.
- `PUT /api/guests/:id`: Update details of a specific guest.
- `DELETE /api/guests/:id`: Delete a specific guest.

## Future Enhancements
We have several planned enhancements for the project, including:
- Adding user authentication and authorization.
- Implementing advanced reporting features.
- Enhancing the user interface with additional customization options.
- Integrating with third-party services for additional functionality.
